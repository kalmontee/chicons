# Fair-Space
Fair Space is an online apartment listing website, offering renters access to information on available units for rent posted directly by landlords themselves.  It's powered by Google Maps, and Rent Estimate APIs to give the consumer the information needed to list and look for fair rental prices.  

Fair Space gives easy access to its listings and makes it simple for landlords to post their apartmemts for rent.  The website is mobile responsive and offers a simple navigation bar for users to easily manuver from page to page.

This aciton will return five comparables so you can get an idea of how much apartments are renting in that area.  You can click on the view apt. button to look up the actual location through google maps.
