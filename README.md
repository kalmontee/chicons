# Fair-Space

Fair-Space is an online apartment listing platform that connects renters directly with landlords. It’s powered by Google Maps and Rent Estimate APIs to help users explore neighborhoods, compare rental prices, and list apartments with confidence.

The site is fully responsive, easy to navigate, and built to make browsing and posting rentals straightforward for everyone.
